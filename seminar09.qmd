## `r fa("compass")` Outline of today

- Goodness-of-fit tests using the $\chi^2$ distribution...
  - ... for a single factor
  - ... for independence of two factors
- How to use `R` to evaluate goodness-of-fit
- Inferences for ANOVA
- Inferences for least squares models

# Goodness-of-fit for a single factor {.mySegue .center}


## What is testing for goodness-of-fit?

- Evaluate distribution of one factor (AKA categorical variable) that has more than two levels (AKA categories)
- Compare observed distribution of the factor (i.e., proportion of sample in each level) to a hypothetical population distribution
- Uses $\chi^2$ distribution test statistic to decide if the deviation is statistically significant 

## Example: Ethnicity in Scotland {.smaller}

Consider the breakdown of population by ethnicity (simplified) from Scotland's Census 2011.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
glimpse(census)
``` 
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
levels(census$ethnicity)
``` 

:::{.callout-warning}
## Level up

To use `levels` the variable (here `ethnicity`) needs to be of type factor (`<fct>`). To coerce strings into factors: `census$ethnicity <- factor(census$ethnicity)`.
:::

:::{.notes}
- Our categorical variable is 'Ethnicity' and it has 4 levels
- Actual categories: Asian = (Asian, Asian Scot, Asian British), Black = (African, Caribbean, Black), Other = (All other and Mixed/Multiple)
:::

## Example: Prison population {.smaller}

![](images/jail.jpg){width=35% .right style="padding:16px" alt="Just visiting jail."}

Ethnicity is not a factor that predisposes one to commit a crime. Therefore, we would expect the prison population of Scotland to mirror the true population of Scotland. 

Suppose we collected a sample of observations of ethnicity from the prison population. 

:::{.callout-tip}
Could we make an inference to decide if the observed difference in the ethnicity of the prison population was significant or due to chance variation?
:::

## Example: Prison population {.smaller}

- To compare the distribution of ethnicity from a sample of the prison population to the distribution of ethnicity in Scotland, we consider a hypothesis test.

- $H_0$ (*nothing* going on - the data is consistent with the specified reference distribution): The prison population is a simple random sample from the total population. The observed counts of prisoners by ethnicity **follow the same** ethnicity **distribution** as population. 

- $H_a$ (something *is* going on, AKA our *research question* - the data is NOT consistent with the specified reference distribution): The prison population is not a simple random sample from the total population. The observed counts of prisoners by ethnicity **do not follow the same** ethnicity **distribution** as population.

## How do we evaluate these hypothesis?

- Quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts.
- Large deviations from what would be expected based on sampling variation alone would be strong evidence against $H_0$.

## Goodness-of-fit test

How well do the observed data fit expected distribution?

```{r}
#| message: false
dattab <- jail |>
 select(ethnicity, perc_census) |> mutate(prop = perc_census/100) |>
 adorn_totals()
dattab$E <- NA
dattab$E[5] <- 2000

kbl(dattab, col.names = c('Ethnicity', "% Population (Census)", "Proportion", "Expected"), booktabs = T)
``` 

:::{.notes}
- Expected: 1920,   54,   20,    6.  Double check this sums to n=2000 (!)
:::

## Conditions

### Independence - sample observations must be independent

- Random sampling
- If sampling w/o replacement, $m < 10%$ population
- Each factor only contributes to one scenario (cell) in table 

### Sample size 

Each scenario (cell) must have at least 5 expected cases

## Anatomy of a test statistic 

:::{.callout-note}
## General form of test statistic

$$\frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE of point estimate}}$$
:::

1. Identify difference between a point estimate and expected value assuming null hypothesis is true.
2. Standardizes the difference using the standard error of the point estimate. 


## Goodness-of-fit statistic

$$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} = V \qquad \sim \chi^2(k-1)$$ 

:::{.callout-note}
## Why square?

1. Positive standardized difference
2. Unusual differences become even more unusual. 
:::

:::{.notes}
- $k$ number of cells i.e. levels of categorical variable; $O$ observed; $E$ expected
- df is $k-1$ number of levels minus 1
:::


## Recall the $\chi^2$ distribution

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE 
#| warning: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Degrees of freedom (df) influences the *shape*, *center* and *spread* of distribution."
chisq.dist <- data.frame(chisq = 0:7000 / 100) |> 
 mutate(df2 = dchisq(x = chisq, df = 2),
        df4 = dchisq(x = chisq, df = 4),
        df9 = dchisq(x = chisq, df = 9)) |>
 gather(key = "df", value = "density", -chisq)
chisq.dist$df <- factor(chisq.dist$df, levels = c("df2", "df4", "df9"), labels = c(2, 4, 9))
ggplot(chisq.dist, aes(x = chisq, y = density, color = df, linetype = df)) +
 geom_line(size = lsz) + ylim(c(0,.6)) + xlim(c(0,15)) +
 labs(y = TeX("$f(x;\\nu)$"), x = TeX("$x$"), color = TeX("$\\nu$ (df)"), linetype = TeX("$\\nu$ (df)")) 
```

## Example: sample data {.smaller}

A random sample of 2000 inmates in year 2011-2012 yields:

```{r}
#| message: false
dattab <- jail |>
 select(ethnicity, perc_census, expec, obs) |>
 adorn_totals()

kbl(dattab, col.names = c('Ethnicity', "% Population (Census)", "Expected", "Observed"), booktabs = T)
``` 

**Compare observed sample to hypothetical expected distribution to understand if the observed differences are due to chance variation alone.**


## Example: calculating test statistic

```{r}
#| message: false
dattab <- jail |>
 select(expec, obs)
dattab$S <- NA

kbl(dattab, col.names = c("Expected", "Observed", "Normalized squared deviations"), booktabs = T)
``` 

:::{.notes}
- Norm sq dev: 0.01302083  0.07407407  6.05000000 10.66666667
- $(1920-1925)^2/1920 + (54-52)^2/54 + (20-9)^2/20 + (6-14)^2/6 = 16.80376$
:::


## $P$-value {.smaller}

- The $P$-value is always positive and a higher value of the test statistic means larger deviations from the null hypothesis. 

- The $P$-value is given by the **tail area to right of calculated statistic**. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pchisq(16.80376, df = 4-1, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

- Since $P$-value of $p = 0.00078 \ll 0.05 = \alpha$ we would **reject** the null hypothesis at $0.05$ level.

- The data provide sufficient evidence that the prison population of Scotland is not representative of the general population. 

:::{.notes}
- Same as $F$ statistic
:::

## Using `R` for Goodness-of-fit for a single factor

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
jail |> select(obs, perc_census) |> glimpse()
```

</br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
chisq.test(jail$obs, p = jail$perc_census, rescale.p = TRUE)
```

# Independence of two factors {.mySegue .center}


## Recall `penguin` data {.smaller}

The Palmer penguin data records species (a factor with three levels) and island (a factor with three levels).

```{r penguins-glimpse, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Two factors: `island` and `species`

The **counts** of data in each factor are used to generate a *contingency table*.

```{r penguins-tab, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
penguins |> tabyl(island, species)
```

</br>

:::{.callout-important}
## `janitor::tabyl` makes creating contingency tables easier. 

The `chisq.test` can be applied to contingency `tabyls`.
:::

## Are island and species independent?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
penguins |> ggplot(aes(island, species)) + geom_bin_2d()
```

## Hypothesis for independence

$H_0: \; p_{ij} = p_{i} \cdot p_{j} \; \forall (i,j)$, i.e. the two factors are independent (the joint distribution can be factored into product of marginals). 

$H_a:$ $H_0$ is false, i.e. the two factors are associated. 

:::{.callout-warning}
## Calculation of $\chi^2$ test statistic

Follows by considering the normalized squared deviations of the expected cell counts in the contingency table. 
:::

## Using `R` for Goodness-of-fit for independence

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
penguins |> tabyl(island, species) |> janitor::chisq.test() 
```
</br>

The data provide very strong evidence ($p < 10^{-16}$) to reject the null hypothesis. Species and island are associated. 


# Inferences for ANOVA {.mySegue .center}


## What hypothesis does ANOVA test?  {.mySegue .center}


## The setting: Linear functions of means {.smaller}

- Your sample has $m$ observations in total.
- Your problem has $k$ populations with means $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_k$ (and equal variances). 
- Suppose your ANOVA test is statistically significant. 

:::{.callout-note}
## Parameter of interest (linear function of means): 

$$\theta = \sum_{i=1}^k c_i \mu_i\,,$$
for constants $c_i$, $i=1,\dots,k$.
:::

## $100(1-\alpha)\%$ CI for $\theta$ 

$$\sum_{i=1}^k c_i \bar{x}_i \pm t_{\alpha/2, m-k} \cdot \left(\mathsf{MSE} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{c_i^2}{m_i}\right)^{1/2}$$

This uses $\mathsf{MSE}$ as an estimator for population variance in $\mathsf{se}(\hat{\theta})$ and $\mathsf{t}(m-k)$ as the sampling distribution for $\hat{\theta}$. 

## Example: ANOVA UK average salary {.smaller}

Average salary data from 20 local councils. Is the mean average salary in each nation the same at 5\% significance level?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
dattab <- salaries |>
 group_by(nation) |>
 summarise(observations = list(mean_salary), n = n(), means = signif(mean(mean_salary), digits = 4), ssds = signif(sd(mean_salary), digits = 4))
kbl(dattab, col.names = c('Nation', "Average salaries ('000 £)", 'Size', 'Sample Mean', 'Sample SD'), align = c("l", "l", "c", "c", "c"), booktabs = T, escape = F)
```   

</br>
```{r} 
#| echo: true
aov(mean_salary ~ nation, data = salaries) |> summary()
```

## $90\%$ CI for $(\mu_{Eng} - \mu_{Sco})$ {.smaller}



What we know:

$m = 20$ obs, $k=4$ groups, with "unequal" design: $m_{Eng} = 6$ and $m_{Sco} = 5$.  
Sample means: $\hat{\mu}_{Eng} = 14.5$ and $\hat{\mu}_{Sco} = 13.0$.

$\mathsf{MSE} = `r summary(oneway)[1][[1]][[3]][[2]]`$ from ANOVA output.

Critical value:
```{r} 
#| echo: true
qt(0.1/2, df = 20 - 4, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Putting it all together...


# Inferences for least squares models {.mySegue .center}


## What parameters can inferences be made for in a least squares model? {.mySegue .center}

## The setting: Least squares model {.smaller}

- Simple linear regression model for response $Y$ with explanatory var $X$:
$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon \,.$$

- Fitted (least squares) line:
$$ \hat{y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 x \,.$$

:::{.callout-note}
- Inferences for $\sigma^2$, variance of random deviation in model (i.e., variance of $\epsilon_i$)
- Inferences for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$
- Prediction intervals for $Y$ given $x$
:::

## Inferences for $\sigma^2$

- Point estimate 
$$S^2 = \frac{\mathsf{RSS}}{m-2}$$
- CI and H-Test use:
$$(m-2) \frac{S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2(m-2) $$

* RSS (residual sum of squares i.e. sum of the squares of residuals)

## H-tests for $\beta_i$

- Null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_i = \beta_{i0}$. 

- T test: 
$$T = \frac{\widehat{\beta}_i - \beta_{i0}}{S \sqrt{c_{ii}}}$$
where $c_{11} = 1/S_{xx}$ and $c_{00} = (\sum x_i^2)/(m S_{xx})$.

- $P$ values are areas under $\mathsf{t}(m-2)$.

## $100(1-\alpha)\%$ CI for $\beta_i$

$$\widehat{\beta}_i \pm t_{\alpha/2, m-2} S \sqrt{c_{ii}}$$
where $c_{11} = 1/S_{xx}$ and $c_{00} = (\sum x_i^2)/(m S_{xx})$.

## Prediction Interval for $Y$

**Prediction interval** for a value of $Y$ when $x = x^*$ is given by 
$$(\widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 x^*) \pm t_{\alpha/2, m-2} S \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x^* - \bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}} $$

:::{.callout-warning}
## This is not the same as the confidence interval for expected $Y$. 

The prediction interval is "wider" than the equivalent confidence interval!
:::

# Bonus {.mySegue .center}

## {.center}

![](images/adelie.png){style="padding:0px" alt="Taking mass of an adelie penguin."}

## Example: Palmer penguins

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylab("Species") + xlab("Body mass (g)") + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Example: Fit of body mass on species {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
fit <- lm(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins)
summary(fit)
```
:::{.notes}
- Defaults to an *effects parameterization*, whereby the first categorical group (here species) is the reference or baseline group and is called the intercept. 
- Estimate for intercept is the first group’s (specie's) mean
- Coefficients for the other groups represent the effect of being in that group, hence the effect parameterization. 
- The way to get the group coefficients for all groups after the first group is to add the estimate of the intercept (first group) to each of the other groups
- It is advisable to ignore the test statistics and p-values for the individual coefficients as there are better ways to examine them.
- F-statistic is the test statistic for ANOVA, e.g., p-value <0.05 tells us that at least one group mean differs from another at the α=0.05 level of significance ...

Recall:
- Residual standard error: This is the standard deviation (spread) of residuals. 
- Multiple R-squared: % of variance explained by model. While a higher R2 is "better", R2 always increases with additional model terms
- Adjusted R-squared: % of variance explained by model adjusted for more model terms that may not be that explanatory. The formula for the adjusted R2 is: $1− (1−R^2) \frac{n−1}{n−p−1}$
- F-statistic: statistic for the model (compared the t statistics which were for individual coefficients). F-statistic tests the null hypothesis that all model coefficients = 0 (ratio of two variances: variance explained by parameters and residual, unexplained variance). You will not typically report an F-statistic in a linear regression model, but you will for an ANOVA.
:::

## Example: Compare `lm` to `aov`...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
onewaypenguin <- aov(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins)
summary(onewaypenguin)
```
